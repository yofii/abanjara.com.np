In August 2019, Doritos decided to go brandless by removing its logo and name from all social media accounts; adding 'Logo Goes Here' in its advertisements. It was a bold move, aiming to appeal to Gen Z.

Another American company, Brandless used to be a brandless brand. It sold products at a much lower price. But, it's failing.

In the world of minimalists, the idea of both using a brand for better, sustainable product and not identifying oneself with any brand is growing. Today, however, we will talk about something different. Personal Branding.

The culture of freelancing is growing and it is extremely difficult to establish yourself in industry. If you happen to visit one of the networking events, you will meet CEOs and Co-founders and changemakers and someone-with-a-fancy-title. For any UXers, there are different titles and position ranging from strategist to unicorn.

> Title Goes Here is a concept, where you are not defined by the position in your company but by the work you do.
